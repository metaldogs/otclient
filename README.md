Here i replicate the module from the Job Application task
There are the scripts i created: https://github.com/metaldogs/otclient/tree/main/modules/game_jump
All the description from what i made are in the comments from jump.lua

I do not have problems to compile the client, since i already know how to compile the server,
the only problem i had, was to find the tibia client to copy the assest folder.
